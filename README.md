# IFCS2 resources

This repository contains resources for teaching programming paradigms for Module One of the **Intensive Foundation to Computer Science and Programming II** course at [Northeastern University London](https://www.nulondon.ac.uk/). The root folder houses three files: `imperative.py`, `procedural.py` and `oop.py`. Please consider attempting the following tasks:

## Task 1

- Download **the folder** to your local computer
- Open the entire folder in your chosen code editor; we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Open `imperative.py`
- Run the program, e.g., `python3 imperative.py`
- Stop the program: `Control + C`
- Attempt to add another city to the Adventure Game using imperative programming only (no subroutines)
- Good luck!

## Task 2

- Open `procedural.py`
- Run the program, e.g., `python3 procedural.py`
- Stop the program: `Control + C`
- Attempt to add another city to the Adventure Game using procedural programming only (no subroutines)
- Good luck!

## Task 3

- Attempt to add another city to the `oop.py` using OOP
